analysing the sub strings 
Observation 1: Since d4d5d6 must be divisible by 5, d6 must be either 0 or 5.

Observation 2: d6d7d8 must be divisible by 11 and from observation 1 we know that d6 is either 0 or 5. if d6 is 0 then the only results are the set {011, 022,…, 099} and those are not pandigital numbers, therefore d6 must be 5.

Observation 3: Since d6 is 5 that limits d6d7d8 are limited to the five-hundreds divisible by 11 with no repeated digits which gives the  set  {506, 517, 528, 539, 561, 572, 583, 594}.

Observation 4: d7d8d9 has to be divisible by 13 and from observation 3 we know have limited d7d8 to 8 combinations. That means we have at maximum 8 sequences for d7d8d9. We can limit d6d7d8d9 to the set of 4 sequences {5286, 5390, 5728, 5832} by eliminating the sequences with repeated digits

Observation 5: Repeating the above for d8d9d10 we get that d6d7d8d9d10 must be in the set {52867, 53901, 57289} so now we have limited the set to 3 possible endings of the pandigital number.

Observation 6: d5d6d7 must be divisible by 7 and must end on 52, 01 or 89. That property limits our ending sequence to d5d6d7d8d9d10 {952867, 357289}

Observation 7: Since d2d3d4 has to be divisible by 2 it means that d4 must be even.  This expands our set significantly to {0952867, 4952867, 0357289, 4357289, 6357289} since there can’t be repeat digits.

Observation 8: We can continue this with analysing d3d4d5 which must be divisible by 3. It must end on {09, 49, 03, 43, 63} and contain no repeat digits.  Based on the digit sum we know that the sum d3 + d4 + d5 be divisible by 3 in order for the number to be divisible by 3. That gives us {30952867, 60357289, 06357289}

Observation 9: The three entries in the set of possible endings has the common thing that non of them contain 1 or 4. Since there are no rules for d1 and d2, we can have both permutations of the two numbers and still have a valid number. That gives us a total of 6 numbers we need to sum up for the result.

Result: 1430952867 +  1460357289 +  1406357289 + 4130952867 + 4160357289 +4106357289 = 16695334890
